# Milvus with LangChain

Milvus is a highly scalable vector database designed to manage, index, and search embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models. This guide demonstrates how to use Milvus with LangChain for managing and querying embedding vectors. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Milvus instance running. You can use Milvus Lite for a local instance or connect to a remote server.

### Installation

You need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --quiet pymilvus langchain_community langchain_milvus
```

## Setup and Initialization

### Setting Up OpenAI Embeddings

To use OpenAIEmbeddings, set your OpenAI API Key:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

### Initializing the Milvus Vector Store

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain_milvus import Milvus
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

# Load and split documents
loader = TextLoader("path_to_your_text_file.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create a Milvus vector store
vector_db = Milvus.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    connection_args={"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "19530"},
)
```

## Basic CRUD Operations

### Create (Insert Documents)

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

docs = [
    Document(page_content="I worked at Kensho", metadata={"namespace": "harrison"}),
    Document(page_content="I worked at Facebook", metadata={"namespace": "ankush"}),
]

vector_db = Milvus.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    connection_args={"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "19530"},
)
```

### Read (Search Documents)

Perform a similarity search on the stored documents:

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson?"
docs = vector_db.similarity_search(query)

for doc in docs:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

### Update (Upsert Documents)

To update or insert new documents:

```python
new_docs = [
    Document(page_content="new_foo", metadata={"id": 1}),
    Document(page_content="new_bar", metadata={"id": 2}),
    Document(page_content="upserted_baz", metadata={"id": 3}),
]

upserted_pks = vector_db.upsert([1, 2, 3], new_docs)
```

### Delete Documents

Delete documents using their primary keys (PKs):

```python
expr = "id in [1, 2]"
pks = vector_db.get_pks(expr)
result = vector_db.delete(pks)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Multiple Collections

Milvus allows you to store unrelated documents in separate collections:

```python
vector_db = Milvus.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    collection_name="collection_1",
    connection_args={"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "19530"},
)

# To retrieve a stored collection:
vector_db = Milvus(
    embeddings,
    connection_args={"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "19530"},
    collection_name="collection_1",
)
```

### Per-User Retrieval (Partitioned Search)

You can implement multi-tenancy using partition keys to separate user data:

```python
docs = [
    Document(page_content="I worked at Kensho", metadata={"namespace": "harrison"}),
    Document(page_content="I worked at Facebook", metadata={"namespace": "ankush"}),
]

vectorstore = Milvus.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    connection_args={"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "19530"},
    drop_old=True,
    partition_key_field="namespace",  # Use "namespace" as the partition key
)

# Search within the "ankush" partition
vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"expr": 'namespace == "ankush"'}).invoke(
    "Where did I work?"
)
```

## Conclusion

This guide provided a comprehensive overview of how to use Milvus with LangChain for various operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. Milvus is a powerful tool for managing large-scale embedding vectors and can be effectively utilized in conjunction with LangChain for robust ML-based applications.
