### **2. Installation**

#### **a. Using Docker**

The easiest way to deploy Qdrant is using Docker. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

2. **Run Qdrant Using Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   ```

   This command starts Qdrant and exposes it on port 6333.

#### **b. Using Pre-built Binaries**

You can also download and run Qdrant directly from pre-built binaries.

1. **Download Qdrant**: Get the latest release from [Qdrant GitHub Releases](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases).

2. **Run Qdrant**:

   ```bash
   ./qdrant --port 6333
   ```

   Ensure the executable has the appropriate permissions.

#### **c. Building from Source**

For advanced use cases or custom builds:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant.git
   cd qdrant
   ```

2. **Build Qdrant**:

   Follow the instructions in the repository’s `README.md` to build from source.

### **3. Basic Usage**

#### **a. Connecting to Qdrant**

You can use the Qdrant Python client to interact with the server:

1. **Install the Qdrant Client**:

   ```bash
   pip install qdrant-client
   ```

2. **Connect to Qdrant**:

   ```python
   from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

   # Initialize Qdrant client
   client = QdrantClient(host='localhost', port=6333)
   ```

#### **b. Creating a Collection**

Define a schema and create a collection:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import VectorParams

# Initialize Qdrant client
client = QdrantClient(host='localhost', port=6333)

# Define collection parameters
collection_name = "example_collection"
vector_params = VectorParams(size=128, distance="Cosine")  # Vector dimension and distance metric

# Create a collection
client.create_collection(collection_name=collection_name, vector_params=vector_params)
```

#### **c. Inserting Data**

Add vectors to the collection:

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
num_vectors = 1000
vectors = np.random.random((num_vectors, 128)).tolist()  # Convert to list of lists
ids = list(range(num_vectors))

# Insert data
client.upsert(collection_name=collection_name, points=[(id, vector) for id, vector in zip(ids, vectors)])
```

#### **d. Searching Data**

Perform a similarity search:

```python
# Create a query vector
query_vector = np.random.random((1, 128)).tolist()

# Search for the top 5 most similar vectors
results = client.search(collection_name=collection_name, query_vector=query_vector, top=5)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result.id, result.score)
```

### **4. Advanced Features**

#### **a. Indexing**

Qdrant uses efficient indexing methods to improve search performance. You can configure indexing options when creating the collection.

#### **b. Filtering**

Apply filters during queries to narrow down search results based on additional criteria:

```python
# Apply a filter (e.g., filter based on metadata)
filter = {"field_name": "value"}

# Perform a search with filter
results = client.search(collection_name=collection_name, query_vector=query_vector, top=5, filter=filter)
```

#### **c. Real-Time Updates**

Qdrant supports real-time updates, allowing you to add or delete vectors on the fly without downtime.

```python
# Upsert new data
client.upsert(collection_name=collection_name, points=[(id, vector)])
```

#### **d. Metadata Storage**

Store additional metadata associated with vectors, which can be useful for filtering and querying.

### **5. Example: Full Workflow**

Here’s a complete example of setting up and using Qdrant:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import VectorParams
import numpy as np

# Initialize Qdrant client
client = QdrantClient(host='localhost', port=6333)

# Create a collection
collection_name = "example_collection"
vector_params = VectorParams(size=128, distance="Cosine")
client.create_collection(collection_name=collection_name, vector_params=vector_params)

# Generate and insert data
num_vectors = 1000
vectors = np.random.random((num_vectors, 128)).tolist()
ids = list(range(num_vectors))
client.upsert(collection_name=collection_name, points=[(id, vector) for id, vector in zip(ids, vectors)])

# Perform a search
query_vector = np.random.random((1, 128)).tolist()
results = client.search(collection_name=collection_name, query_vector=query_vector, top=5)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result.id, result.score)
```
